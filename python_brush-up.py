# modules üòÅ
# you put functions in othre <file>.py and import them for usebility
# import KgtoLbs
# KgtoLbs.convertKgtoLbs(30)  #convert is a function in the KgtoLbs module
# you could import functions directly  # from KgtoLbs import convertKgtoLbs  # you don't need to use KgtoLbs.convertKgtoLbs just call the function normaaly
# from KgtoLbs import convertKgtoLbs as conv # to rename the function

# data passing
# python doesn't pass by reference or by value. is passes by something called "object-reference-pass-by-value"
# ex x = 3 , x is a var assigned to a reference of an object of value 3, you can reassign x to a d differenct referenece of an object or change the object itself which you will see in other vars that are assigned to a reference to that object  use id(x) to check unique id of the object
